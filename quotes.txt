Follow the white rabbit
Often wrong, never in doubt
What are you afraid of losing, when nothing in the world acually belongs to you
Is it still January, Pooh? Yes, Piglet. It's still fucking January.
Any fool can know. The point is to understand. 
The most dangarous addiction is the approval of others
Smile. Listen. Agree. And then do whaterver the fuck you wanted to do anyway.
There is no spoon
I like this place and coudl willingly waste my time in it
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
