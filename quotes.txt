Follow the white rabbit
Often wrong, never in doubt
What are you afraid of losing, when nothing in the world acually belongs to you
Is it still January, Pooh? Yes, Piglet. It's still fucking January.
Any fool can know. The point is to understand. 
The most dangarous addiction is the approval of others
Smile. Listen. Agree. And then do whaterver the fuck you wanted to do anyway.
There is no spoon
I like this place and could willingly waste my time in it
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
I took the miracle move on drug but the effects were temporary
Mondays aren`t so bad, it`s your job that sucks
You only live once, and the way I live, once is enough.
It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything
To thine own self be true
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them
The obstacle is the way
You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at itself
Be water, my friend
Ideas are bulletproof
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life
If it is endurable, then endure it. If it is not, then stop complaining
Sometimes I walk in pity for myself but all the while a great wind carries me across the sky
